G3D 8.xx Build System Instructions

(If you are on Windows or OS X, you can use the precompiled binaries
provided on our website http://g3d.sf.net for regular and beta
releases instead of building by yourself.)



To properly run the G3D build scripts you will need the following
software.  It is all available for free and comes pre-installed on
most OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD systems:

* Python 2.4 or later (http://www.python.org) 
* On OS X, Linux, or FreeBSD you will need gcc 4.0 or later
* On Windows you will need Visual C++ 9.0 (Visual Studio 2008),
   either the full or Express version (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/)

To build the documentation target, the following are also required:

* Doxygen 1.5 or later (http://www.doxygen.org)
* Latex (on Windows: http://miktex.org/)
* Ghostscript (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/)

The OSX, Linux and FreeBSD builds require the following library packages
(these will be built if they are not found on your system):

* libpng 1.2 (http://www.libpng.org/)
* libjpeg 6 (http://www.ijg.org/)
* libz (http://www.zlib.net/)

The Linux and FreeBSD builds require the following library packages:

* libzip (http://nih.at/libzip/)
* libsdl 1.2 dev (http://www.libsdl.org/)
* Distribution-specific x11-dev (x11/xorg development libraries + headers)

The OSX and Linux builds will install an internal version of FFmpeg
(http://ffmpeg.org/) to the G3D installation directory so be careful
not to overwrite a previously installed version unintentionally.

It is possible to build the library on Windows using the Visual
Studio IDE, however documentation, headers, demos, and other aspects
of the full build will be missing.  The G3D team DOES NOT SUPPORT
direct use of the Visual Studio project files.  We only support
the build scripts that call them.

[We are often asked why we don't use CMake.  We previously used CMake
and found that it was too hard to maintain the source files, was
inflexible, and gave incorrect dependency checking under Visual
Studio.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------

To create and install all of G3D, at the command line execute:

    buildg3d --install update

You can build just the libraries (much faster) with:

    buildg3d --install lib

If you chose to specify the optional install directory for the build,
set your G3DDATA directory to that directory + G3D/data

(On Unix-like operating systems you may need to first execute
"chmod a+x buildg3d" and run this command as "./buildg3d",
depending on your system configuration.)

Run "buildg3d help" for more information about the build sytem.
