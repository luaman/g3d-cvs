@section intent Intent of License
   (This section is informal and not legally binding.)

   <BR> This library is free code-- you can use it without charge and
   it is minimally legally encumbered.  Unlike some other free libraries,
   we <B>do not</B> require you to release
   your source code or make your own program open source.

   <P> I intend the license (below) to protect me and the other
   contributors from liability and allow you to use the source however
   you want.  You can make your own closed or open-source programs,
   sell them, give them away, whatever.

   <P>
   The license for G3D itself and the libaries included in the G3D distribution
   create certain documentation obligations for you.
   For convenience, G3D::license is a function that returns the license
   string you must put in your documentation.  G3D::GApp will automatically
   write a file (g3d-license.txt) to disk with the contents of this
   license unless you tell it not to, thus automatically satisfying your
   documentation requirement after the first time you run a G3D program.
   
   <P>
   Most of the data resources have either entered the public domain and have
   been in several published papers or are data that I have explicitly 
   received permission to distribute with G3D.  The G3D fonts are actually font
   images, not TrueType font descriptions and may be freely
   distributed.  As a rule of thumb, you can freely use and distribute
   anything you find in the data directory but may need permission to use
   it in a commercial product.  Check the various copyright.txt files
   in the data directories for specific information.

   <P> 

   You are required by the BSD license to acknowledge G3D in your 
   documentation.  This can be as minimal as a note buried in the
   fine print at the end of a manual or a text file accompanying
   your program.  I appreciate it if you acknowledged the library
   more publicly but you aren't required to.

   <P>
   
   Likewise, you are encouraged but not required to submit patches to
   improve the library for the benefit of all.  Post bugs,
   patches, and questions to the g3d-users forum linked at the top of this page.
   <P>
