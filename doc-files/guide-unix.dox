/** @page guideunix Installing %G3D on Unix-based Operating Systems (OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD)

The following sections give step-by-step instructions for downloading,
building, and installing the 8.00 version of %G3D on OS X and Linux.

The short version of these instructions is simple:

\htmlonly
<ol>
<li> Unzip <a
href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/g3d/G3D-8.00-src.zip?download">G3D-8.00-src.zip</a>
<li> Type <code>buildg3d --install /usr/local update</code> to build the library
<li> Set your G3DDATA environment variable to the <code>/usr/local/G3D/data</code> directory
<li> See <code><a href="file:///usr/local/G3D/samples/starter/">/usr/local/G3D/samples/starter/</A></code> for a simple application framework
</ol>
\endhtmlonly
</p>

The G3D team fully supports G3D on OS X, including the build system and working around GPU driver problems on that platform.

We answer any questions posted to the user forum about any operating system.  However,
we do not officially provide build support on Linux (or FreeBSD), or work arounds for driver bugs on Linux.  There are many reasons for this.  The GPU vendors have
not provided reliable drivers for Linux.  There are many Linux distributions, each with its own quirks.
The G3D team members largely do not develop on Linux themselves,
and therefore are poorly positioned to support it--there is currently no Linux team lead. If you would like
to improve our Linux support and are an experienced Linux developer, volunteer to be the new Linux team lead by posting on the user forum.

<ol>
<li>Execute the following commands at the terminal prompt on your local machine to download, build, and install G3D:

<pre>
pushd /tmp
curl http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/g3d/G3D-8.00-src.zip?download > G3D-8.00-src.zip
unzip G3D-8.00-src.zip
pushd G3D

# Read the instructions; make sure you have the required packages!

chmod u+x buildg3d
sudo ./buildg3d --install /usr/local update
popd
rm -rf G3D
popd
</pre>

<p>
<li>You probably want to bookmark the local G3D documentation at
<code>/usr/local/G3D/html/index.html</code>.  Sample projects and
data files can be found at <code>/usr/local/G3D/data</code> and
<code>/usr/local/G3D/demos</code>.
</p>

<p>
<li>G3D comes with a build tool called iCompile that automatically compiles and links programs using g++ on Linux and OS X.  This is a replacement for Makefiles. 
 If you choose to use it and installed G3D to a path that is not already in your
INCLUDE and LIBRARY variables, then you need to edit your <code>~/.icompile</code> file to work with G3D.  See the <a
href="icompile-manual.html" >iCompile Manual</a> for details.  A sample .icompile file that assumes you built in your home directory and never installed to the system is:

<pre>
<font size=2>
[GLOBAL]
defaultinclude:  $(INCLUDE);/usr/include;/usr/X11R6/include;/usr/local/include;/usr/local/include/SDL11;/usr/include/SDL;/Volumes/Home/Projects/G3D/build/linux-i386-g++-4.0/include
defaultlibrary:  $(LIBRARY);$(LD_LIBRARY_PATH);/usr/lib;/usr/X11R6/lib;/usr/local/lib;/Volumes/Home/Projects/G3D/build/linux-i386-g++-4.0/lib
